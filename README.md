Firmware created to collect sensor data based on the Particle Boron on the Particle Platform

# What is µPSTREAM?
µPSTREAM (pronounced up-stream) is a broad term used to describe the use of a sensor connected to a device (e.g. microcontroller, RPi) with a network connection (e.g. wifi, cellular, satellite, LoRA) through which collected data is transmitted directly to a datastore for analysis and/or model integration.
